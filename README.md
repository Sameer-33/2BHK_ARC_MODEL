2️⃣&3️⃣  Architectural Planning and Structural Detailing:
The focus was on creating a robust and efficient structure while maintaining an optimized layout for the building's needs. The project integrates a north-facing design layout, maximizing natural light and ventilation while staying true to modern architectural standards.
Labeled rooms with functional space distribution make this design both practical and adaptable.
 
4️⃣ Furniture Layout and Visualization:
Carefully crafted interior spaces featuring labeled furniture layouts for enhanced usability and aesthetic appeal.
The model brings together detailed visualization, making it easy to understand the spatial dynamics and overall flow of the building.


This project was an excellent learning experience that helped me refine my skills in:
3D modeling and structural analysis.
Space planning and functional design.
Leveraging Autodesk Revit for creating high-quality, professional architectural projects.
I’m proud to have brought this vision to life and am excited to apply these skills to future endeavors. Your thoughts and feedback would be greatly appreciated!
